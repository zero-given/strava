- What we did: Modified layout.tsx to use inline styles
- Result: Failed - background still white

Technical Analysis of Success:
1. Why it worked:
   - Applying styles directly to the main content component
   - Bypassed potential style conflicts from layout or theme components
   - Inline styles have high specificity and aren't affected by CSS modules

2. Key Learnings:
   - Next.js page components can override layout styles
   - Inline styles are effective when dealing with style inheritance issues
   - Component-level styling can be more reliable than global styles

3. Implementation Details:
   Original code:
   ```tsx
   <main className="min-h-screen">
   ```
   
   Working solution:
   ```tsx
   <main className="min-h-screen" style={{ backgroundColor: 'yellow' }}>
   ```

This log serves as a reference for future styling challenges in Next.js applications with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
